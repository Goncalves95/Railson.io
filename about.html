            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              Railson Viana, a Brazilian-born artist who became a naturalized Portuguese citizen, was born in 1992 and
              moved to Portugal in 2011. Initially trained as a Physical Therapist Technician, he later pursued a
              Communication Design Course in Faro, where he excelled as the top student and received a scholarship of
              excellence from the University of Algarve. Railson's artistic journey began in childhood, fueled by a
              passion for drawing, painting, and disassembling objects, along with a fascination for nature and
              technology.

            </p>
            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              Self-taught in drawing and painting, Railson was influenced by his older sister, Edna Lima, prompting him
              to combine his natural artistic abilities with academic studies. His artistic repertoire spans various
              mediums, including photography, drawing, oil paintings, acrylic, Chinese ink, watercolor, and more.
              Railson's creations reflect themes of Minimalism, Liquid Modernity and Aesthetic.

            </p>
            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              Railson possesses an exclusive collection of paintings and NFTâ€™s exhibited in Portugal and Dubai.

            </p>
            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              In addition to his diverse artistic pursuits, Railson decided to venture into tattooing, expanding his
              creative activities.

            </p>
            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              Currently residing in Switzerland for nearly three years, he is actively seeking a suitable place and team
              to further develop his skills and immerse himself in the exciting world of tattoo art.

            </p>
            <p class="text-blk section-text">
              He is currently participating in a talent hub at Absolut Art in Zurich. The application of his artistic
              knowledge to tattooing demonstrates the versatility and innovation that Railson seeks in his creative
              journey.
